* Freetrack tracker class.
* FreeTrack is a free optical motion tracking application for Microsoft Windows, released under the
* GNU General Public License. Its main function is inexpensive head tracking in computer games and 
* simulations but can also be used for general computer accessibility, in particular hands-free 
* computing. Tracking is sensitive enough that only small head movements are required so that the 
* user's eyes never leave the screen. <http://www.free-track.net/english/>
