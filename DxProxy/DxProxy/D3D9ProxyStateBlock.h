/**
* D3D proxy state block class - broker class for any device states.
*
* Responsible for applying state changes to the proxy device so that the proxy devices state remains
* consistent with the actual devices state when an actual state block is applied.
*
* Also responsible for ensuring that the correct side is applied for stereo components. (The side at 
* the time of capture may not match the side when the state block is applied.)
* 
*
* All simple states can be tracked by the device. This is basically all states that are basic value 
* types rather than interfaces (For example, everything set by SetSamplerState).
*
*
* Any states that are wrapped need to have the wrapped state stored. (Textures, Vertex/Pixel Shaders,
* etc.)
* 
* For stereo components like Textures all parameters needed to manually re-apply them need to be 
* saved (textures only need the texture and the number of the sampler the texture is in). This is 
* because we can't guarantee that all states will be saved while the same side is active. If all 
* states were saved on the same side then the stereo components won't need to be reapplied and the 
* procedure will be the same as for non-stereo components stated below.
*
* Non-stereo componenets like Vertex Buffers and Shaders just need the wrapper reference stored in 
* order to be able to restore the wrapper in the device proxy. The actual state will be restored on 
* the device by the actual StateBlock.
*
*
* View, projection and world matrix because we keep a left and right version. (TODO World matrix 
* might be world-view in which case there will be left and right versions. Don't have a good way to 
* handle this yet (or a test case), leaving world matrix to actual device for now)
*
* Ignore Texture transforms - assumed to always be mono at the moment.
*
* Don't save stereo versions of constants. Will be recalculated as needed from dirty registers when 
* proxy registers have been restored.
*
* Pixel shader constants TODO - if needed (if stereo'ified for some reason), otherwise leave these to 
* the actual device.
