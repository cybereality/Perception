/**
* Game-specific shader modification handling class.
* TODO implementation - For now use one set of rules for everything, at some point this is probably 
* going to need to be reworked to allow modifications per game.
* TODO - externalise these as rules? It might be good to have default values for various rules like
* "Don't duplicate targets smaller than X pixels", where that rule could be enabled and the value 
* changed in the cfg file for the game.
* Do something similar to shader modifications?
* Extending class and overriding these methods would end up with a similar problem with duplicate code
* to original shader handling. Try and avoid (or at least find approach that avoids the duplication)
