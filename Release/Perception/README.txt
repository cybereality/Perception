NOTES:
---------------------------------
- For some games, you only need to leave the Perception app open when you launch the game. For other games you may need to follow specific instructions, see below.

- For best performance, be sure to disable vertical sync.

- It is better to adjust all game settings before playing with the driver, as changing certain settings may cause the game to crash (i.e. changing the resolution).

- With formats that split the screen (side-by-side, etc.) the mouse icon may not be located with where the cursor actually is. 

- If the app crashed when you select a display mode, you may want to right-click the Perception.exe and choose "Run as Administrator"

- SLI and CrossfireX may cause strange flickering on some titles (ie L4D2).

- It is NOT recommended that you play online games since the driver could be detected as a hack and you may be banned.

- If the Hillcrest Labs tracker appears unresponsive, try shaking it as the game loads. 

- Some games produce extreme lag when using the Hillcrest Labs tracker. In those cases you must disable tracking and use the built-in mouse emulation.
